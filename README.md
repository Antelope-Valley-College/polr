Polr is an intrepid, self-hostable open-source link shortening web application with a robust API. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, to brand your URLs, and to gain control over your data. Polr is especially easy to use, and provides a modern, themable feel.

[Getting Started](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation/) - [API Documentation](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/developer-guide/api/) - [Contributing](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) - [Bugs](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/issues) - [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#polr)

### Quickstart

*This* version Polr is written in PHP and the Laravel framework, using MySQL as its primary database. It was upgraded from the Lumen framework to enable it to run natively on PHP 8.

 - To get started with Polr on your server, check out the [installation guide](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation/). You can clone this repository, or download a [release](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/releases).
 - To get started with the Polr API, check out the [API guide](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/developer-guide/api/).


Installation TL;DR: clone or download this repository, set document root to `public/`, create MySQL database, go to `yoursite.com/setup` and follow instructions.

Developers: Download the deploy.sh and either build_dev.(sh|ps1) files to quickly deploy a local MySQL and Polr container using docker (or syntactically equivalent) container software. Read the build_dev file for use directions. In theory, this could also be used as a starting point for a production Polr container stack.

### PHP Dependencies

### SAML Support(!)

This fork supports SAML 2 integration. SAML integration provides authorization for internal accounts. Accounts can be created on demand. Attributes can be used to flag an account as a permitted user and as an administrator and are always applied or removed at SAML login. SAML can be configured in addition to or instead of internal authorization. A local account can be converted to a SAML account simply by logging in to an IdP with the same username as the local account. A SAML account can be reverted to a local account by resetting the password.
