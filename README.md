Polr is an intrepid, self-hostable open-source link shortening web application with a robust API. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, to brand your URLs, and to gain control over your data. Polr is especially easy to use, and provides a modern, themable feel.

### Quickstart

Polr is written in PHP and Lumen, using MySQL as its primary database.

 - To get started with Polr on your server, check out the [installation guide](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/installation/). You can clone this repository, or download a [release](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/releases).
 - To get started with the Polr API, check out the [API guide](http://docs.polrproject.org/en/latest/developer-guide/api/).


Installation TL;DR: clone or download this repository, set document root to `public/`, create MySQL database, go to `yoursite.com/setup` and follow instructions.

### SAML Support(!)

This fork supports SAML 2 integration. SAML integration provides authorization for internal accounts. Accounts can be created on demand. Attributes can be used to flag an account as a permitted user and as an administrator and are always applied or removed at SAML login. SAML can be configured in addition to or instead of internal authorization. A local account can be converted to a SAML account simply by logging in to an IdP with the same username as the local account. A SAML account can be reverted to a local account by resetting the password.
